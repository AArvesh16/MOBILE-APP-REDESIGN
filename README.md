**Introduction**

Pepperfry is a leading online furniture and home décor e-commerce platform, offering a vast selection of products. However, its mobile app has some usability and design challenges that affect the user experience, such as cluttered navigation, a complex checkout process, and inefficient product discovery.

To address these issues, I took the initiative to redesign the Pepperfry mobile app in Figma, focusing on enhancing usability, streamlining the shopping journey, and improving aesthetics. My goal was to make the app more intuitive, visually appealing, and conversion-driven, ensuring a seamless shopping experience for users.

**How I Created the Redesign**

1. Research & Problem Identification
Before starting the redesign, I conducted thorough research and usability analysis of the existing Pepperfry mobile app. This included:

User Feedback Analysis: Studying app reviews on the Play Store and App Store to identify common complaints.
Competitor Benchmarking: Analyzing UI/UX patterns from competitors like IKEA, Urban Ladder, and Amazon Home.
Heuristic Evaluation: Examining navigation flow, visual hierarchy, and checkout process to spot friction points.

Through my research, I found key issues that needed improvement:
 Complicated product search & filters – Users struggled to find relevant products.
 Cluttered UI & overwhelming product display – Too much information on a single screen.
 Lengthy checkout process – High cart abandonment rates due to friction in purchasing.

2. Wireframing & Prototyping in Figma
After identifying problems, I started with low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to create a structured layout for the app. My approach included:

A cleaner homepage with a focus on trending and personalized recommendations.
A simplified navigation bar for quick access to categories and offers.
An optimized product page with improved images, reviews, and CTA buttons.
Once the wireframes were finalized, I created high-fidelity UI designs and interactive prototypes to test user interactions.

3. Tools & Technologies Used
To bring my design ideas to life, I used the following tools:
 Figma – For wireframing, UI design, and interactive prototyping.
 Material Design & Apple HIG – To ensure consistency in UI elements.
 Icons8 & Unsplash – For high-quality icons and product images.
 Color Contrast & Accessibility Checkers – To enhance readability and inclusivity.

4. Features & Improvements in the Redesign
 Improved Navigation & Search:

Introduced a sticky bottom navigation bar with easy access to Home, Categories, Cart, and Profile.
Added an AI-powered smart search with voice and image search features.
 Optimized Product Discovery & Shopping Experience:

Redesigned product filters to allow multi-selection and sorting in one step.
Enhanced the wishlist and comparison feature to help users make informed decisions.
 Faster Checkout & Payment Process:

Implemented a one-page checkout to reduce cart abandonment.
Added multiple payment options, including UPI, EMI, and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL).
 Enhanced Mobile Responsiveness & Performance:

Created a fully adaptive UI to fit different screen sizes and dark mode support.

5. Where This Redesign is Applicable
The redesigned Pepperfry mobile app can be useful in several ways:

Official App Revamp: If implemented, it can enhance Pepperfry's user experience and increase conversion rates.
Portfolio Case Study: Showcasing my UX problem-solving skills to potential employers.
E-Commerce UI/UX Best Practices: Applying these UX principles to other shopping apps like Myntra, Flipkart, and Amazon.

6. Challenges & Learnings
During the redesign process, I faced several challenges:

Balancing aesthetics and functionality – Ensuring a visually appealing UI while maintaining a seamless UX.
Handling large product catalogs – Optimizing UI for thousands of SKUs while maintaining performance.
Ensuring accessibility – Improving readability for users with visual impairments.
This project strengthened my UX/UI skills, particularly in mobile-first design, usability testing, and conversion optimization.

**Conclusion**
Through this redesign, I successfully created a modern, user-friendly, and conversion-focused Pepperfry mobile app that enhances the shopping experience. By using Figma, user research, and UX best practices, I transformed the app into a clean, intuitive, and highly engaging e-commerce platform.

This case study showcases my ability to identify UX problems, design innovative solutions, and create seamless digital experiences.
